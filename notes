Fingerprint stuff:

Finished alignment, now you can correspond the minutia!
Corresponding minutia requires two steps:
1 - Check the distance between them, if they are within a cerain threshold, then process to 2
2 - Check the angles of the minutia, and if they are within a certain threshold, they are corresponding.

After they are corresponded, you can begin to measure the distance between them, and then detwrmine a match score

Now we are going to cover algorithms:

Minutia have 4 dimensions: (X position, Y position, Angle, Type)

Gabor filtering is the 'best' way to enhance a fingerprint

Fourier Transform method and Histogram Equalization are other methods that don't work as well

Binarization is done after enhancement, and this just sets the contrast threshold to infinity *basically*
During Binarization you invert the colors, this helps you with the math later.

After binarization you thin the image, this reduces the fingerprints to single pixel lines

Then you find minutia points, you do this by walking around the outside of the square and count the number of 1-0 transitions. The number of these determines the type of minutia

Then you remove spurious minutia points. There are 7 types of spurious minutia. Scars are considered to be spurious, which is really goddamn annoying to remember.

Facial Recognition

For 1:1 recognition, accuracy is extremely high, however, for 1:n, the accuracy is lower, obviously.
Facial Recognition is the easiest to collect

Different feature levels:
1: Gross features like shape of the face
2: Structure of face, relationship between components
3: Unstructured micro features, mole, freckles, pores
